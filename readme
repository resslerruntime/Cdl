Cdl


Brick is a recognizable element (component) with own construction rules and properties. Cdl format allows you also to define extra data for example like Oceans data.


One tag bricks

Brick definition describe simply tag with all parameters and construction rules - name of other bricks you can have inside, before and after. You can also define the proper position.

Brick are recognized by marks - class, attributes. You can also recognize a brick by position, for example as the first element inside div.my-class.
You don’t have to define mark attributes as properties, cdl will do this automatically.



Complex bricks

You can also define a more complex bricks with inside construction. To do this you have to use „:” sign for pos mark and position rule. Cdl can automatically analyze html body to define inside bricks.

<div class=“my-complex-type”>
     <span>hello</span>
     <span></span>
</div>

In this case Cdl will define myComplexType:0 brick with pos and positions set to ... but also ...:1 as empty.

What about the type of inside empty elements? Normally all empty elements (slots) have the inside rule from the main brick. You can set also to read only or own - inherited from recognized brick like span in our example. 
To do different define only a brick at certain position name:1:0. If Cdl will find already defined element, will not analyze this brick even if exist in body content.

To analyze body set reqbody=true and define brick body in a separate file.

You can also use reqbody to set static properties, not defined manually.
